## Application!

Hello all, and welcome to our site dedicated to assisting both job seekers and small businesses who are seeking new candidates for their existing or up and coming business.

Our application which has been dubbed "TechRaccoon" is geared towards folks and businesses that are looking to hire within the tech industry, whether that is in software engineering or within programming universe. This application is catered to those that are looking to expand their horizons with their existing skills, or learn some new skills from a new job environment!

This application takes advantage of several different types of data that are gathered from SQL servers, backend javascript, handlebars to operate the front end, and of course API routes!

The application is meant to gather certain skills from applicants that want to list their knowledge base. Using things like education and coding launguages, to employnent history just to name a few. Our application is also designed to filter out applicants with certain requirements they prefer. Such as a degree or certification.

Our app is geared for those who would like to create a login and track their application history and edit some profile options, creating a more personalized experience for both the user and the employer. 

We wanted our application to be as user friendly and intuitive as possible without becoming overbearing, and the result is something fairly simple that results in catering to nearly all audiences. The small businesses that are looking to hire new candidates for their team or the folks that are straight out of college!
